        <!-- DESCRIPCION -->
       <p>The Thunder 40 PRO is the perfect choice for those looking for a gun with the stopping power of a 40 S&amp;W.</p>
       <p>Conceived as a law enforcement and military service weapon, you can depend on this gun for service, self defense or sports.</p>
       <p>Its capacity, accuracy and reliability are an excellent combination for a pistol. They also became a good choice in sport disciplines as IPSC and IDPA.</p>
       <p>It is an ergonomically excellent gun. Every single detail in its design has been well cared to for providing comfort and safety. This model is 100% ambidextrous since its safety levers and slide stop levers are located on both sides of the grip, and its magazine catch is also reversible.</p>
       <p>The Thunder PRO's polygonal rifled barrel offers an excellent performance and durability, and a new firing pin design provides an extremely durable life for a service pistol.</p>
       <p>The location of the safety and decocker grant unequalled comfort and a perfect grip.</p>
       <p>The Thunder 40 PRO has the Improved Browning Petter barrel locking system, giving an excellent reliability during ejection of empty cases and feeding live ammo.</p>
    <p>As we always do, safety is first, and Thunder 40 PRO has many safety devices: manual safety lever and decocker, firing pin safety, hammer automatically remains in half cock notch and separate the hammer from the firing pin, and a new loaded chamber indicator.</p>
    <p>FINISHES: matte blue. It also comes in two tones with nickel plated slide and an anodized frame for superficial hardening and corrosion resistance.</p>
    <p>REAR SIGHT: Dovetail fixed, with white dots, u or bar for faster target acquisition.</p>

        <!-- DESCRIPCION -->
     <p>By preserving the features of the bigger models but also reducing its size, we obtained one of the best semi-automatic pistols for this caliber.</p>
     <p>Although its capacity is smaller than Thunder 9 PRO high capacity, it is bigger than most in its category. Most importantly, it keeps its absolute accuracy and reliability. This pistol has a surprisingly compact size and as well as comfortable.</p>
     <p>This model is 100% ambidextrous like high capacity versions. Its safety and decocker lever and slide stop levers are located on both sides of the gun. The magazine catch is also reversible. The location of the safety and decocker grant unequalled comfort and perfect grip.</p>
     <p>The Thunder 9 Ultra Compact PRO has the Improved Browning Petter barrel locking system, giving an excellent reliability during ejection of empty cases and feeding live ammo.</p>
     <p>As we always do, safety is first, and Thunder 9 Ultra Compact PRO has many safety devices: manual safety lever and decocker, firing pin safety, hammer automatically remains in half cock notch and separate the hammer from the firing pin, and a new loaded chamber indicator. This compact pistol has also a Integral Locking System, to store the gun safely.</p>
     <p>REAR SIGHT: Dovetail fixed, with white dots, u or bar for faster target acquisition.</p>
     <p>FRONT SIGHT: fixed in the slide with white dot for faster target acquisition.</p>
     <p>FINISHES: matte blue. It also comes in two tones with nickel plated slide and an anodized frame for superficial hardening and corrosion resistance. </p>
